Section 9: Performance Optimization
1. Overview: Premature optimization is the root of all evils.
* Most web application follow three tier architecture: Data (SQL), Application (IIS - Web Server), Client (Browser)
* Optimization in the data tier will have the most gain and as we move towards the client here our optimization will have less OBSERVABLE result
* Optimization rules
** Do not sacrifile the maintainability of your code to premature optimization
** Be realistic and think like an "engineer"
** Be pragmatic and ensure your efforts have observable results and give value (to the users and business, dont wasting your time and your employer's money)

2. Data Tier
* Data Tier: Schema and Queries
* Schema issues: Primary Keys, Relationships and Indexes
* Schema issues: Entities, Attributes, Value (EAV)
* Problems with EAV pattern: 
** No O/RMs
** Long, gigantic queries
** Extremely slow

* Queries
** Optimizing Queries: Use Execution Plan in SQL server.
** Create a "read" database (look up CQRS)
** Use caching
